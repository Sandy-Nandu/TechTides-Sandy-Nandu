## Failure Modes
1. **Tool Wear Failure (TWF)**: Tool wear time exceeds 200â€“240 minutes.
2. **Heat Dissipation Failure (HDF)**: Air-to-process temperature difference < 8.6 K and rotational speed < 1380 rpm.
3. **Power Failure (PWF)**: Power required for the process < 3500 W or > 9000 W.
4. **Overstrain Failure (OSF)**: Tool wear and torque product exceed thresholds based on product variants.
5. **Random Failures (RNF)**: Random 0.1% chance of failure.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Handling Categorical Data**:
   - Product ID encoded as categories (L, M, H).
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculate temperature difference: `Process Temp - Air Temp`
   - Compute power: `Torque * Rotational Speed`
   - Stress factor: Derived using tool wear and rotational speed.
3. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize continuous features (e.g., temperature, torque).
4. **Validation**:
   - Ensure no missing values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized failure rates across failure modes.
- Analyzed distributions of continuous variables like air temperature and torque.
- Key insights:
  - Tool wear and temperature differences highly correlate with failures.
  - Lower rotational speeds link to higher failure rates.
  
**Example Visualizations**:
- Boxplot: Air temperature vs. machine failure
- Histogram: Tool wear distribution
- Pie chart: Failure mode proportions

## Recommendations
1. **Monitor Tool Wear**:
   - Replace tools before reaching critical thresholds.
2. **Optimize Temperatures**:
   - Maintain stable air and process temperatures.
3. **Control Rotational Speed**:
   - Adjust to avoid overstrain and related failures.
4. **Implement Predictive Maintenance**:
   - Use ML models for early failure detection.

## Limitations
1. Dataset is synthetic and does not capture the full complexity of real-world industrial processes.
2. Failure modes are predefined and may not encompass all real scenarios.
3. Results may require validation with real industrial data.
